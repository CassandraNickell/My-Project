<center><h1>My Life during MCO in UiTM </center></h1>

<font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> 
<p> Hello my name is Cassandra Nickell Bonniface. I am currently in my last semester of Diploma in Information Management in Uitm Kota Samarahan, Sarawak. <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= SpringGreen> 18 March 2020 was the first day of Movement Control Order (MCO). <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> So my flight got cancelled on 19 March 2020 because of it. I was disappointed knowing that i could not be there with my family during MCO. I believe other students also feel the same. I have anxiety to stay in college because i know i will feel lifeless here. 

<font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= skyblue>However, I believe that in every darkness, there's a light. In every struggle, there's a way.
<font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> There are approximately 694 students stranded in UiTM Samarahan Campus 1 and 320 students in Campus 2. UiTM did a very good job to make sure we are safe and not lack of anything. UiTM provides 3 meals a day (Breakfast, lunch and dinner) and basic necessities.

<p> Even though we are safe in here, but we cannot simply go anywhere. The only places we can go are including <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= orange> College <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> (where we stay), <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= orange> BMart <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> (To buy something), <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= orange> Cafe <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> (To get the food), and <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= orange> ATM <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> (To withdraw money). Staying 24 hours in the room makes me feel stress and lonely. Everyday feels the same. Usually, breakfast will be given around 8:30am. I think it is too early. I always skipped breakfast just to make sure i have enough sleep in the morning because i love to sleep and sleeping is one of my priorities in life. While, for lunch on 12pm and dinner on 5pm, schedule is prepared for us to take turn to get the food from cafe. For example, every tuesday, i will take the food for everyone in my level which is Seri Gading 1B Level 2. The main reason why we have schedule is because of <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= skyblue> social distancing. <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= White> It is to prevent us to gather in a big crowd.  

<p> If any of my friends or family asked what did i do today, my answer will always be <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= SpringGreen> 'Watching a movie or variety show, sleep, eat and repeat'. <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white>  Luckily, i have a friend that i am close with. Her name is Natashya Uring Daniel. Although we are in a different room, we always spend our time together. In the evening, we always go to BMart to buy ice cream. Sometimes, we walked around the college from Block 1 to Block 4 to release tension and enjoy the fresh air. I am grateful to have her with me here.

<font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white>
<p>The best thing i always do is <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= skyblue> video-calling with my friends and family. <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> My mum never missed to give me a call or send me a text every single day. I know she is definitely missing me and worried about me. I really miss them. At least video-calling with them can reduce the feeling of longing and lonely. I wanted to go back home but after i saw a post in Twitter saying that <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= orange> "YOU ARE NOT STUCK AT HOME, YOU ARE SAFE AT HOME" <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= white> made me realized that staying here is way better than going to any places in this moment. Since Online learning has started, i feel bit alive because finally i have something to do to keep myself busy. I love being busy rather than doing nothing at all. I hope everything will be back to normal as soon as possible. <font face="Bahnschrift SemiBold Condensed" , size= 5, color= red> Stay safe and Stay healthy. </blockquote>
